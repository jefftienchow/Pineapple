#Pineapple
One Player Pineapple:
The first five cards are placed just as in regular open face poker, but then players get dealt three cards instead of just one. In turn, each player then places two of the three cards in any of his or her available rows before discarding the third one face down. The procedure is repeated until players have completed their 13-card hands.

The goal is to have the top row have the weakest hand, the middle row have the second weakest hand, and the bottom row have the strongest hand. If this order is not obeyed, the player "fouls" and earns zero points. The player earns points based on the strength of the hand in each row. 

If a player has a hand of double Q's or higher on the top row and does not foul, that player will enter fantasyland in which 14 cards are shown to the player and the player plays them all at once. If that player wishes to enter another fantasyland from fantasyland, the player must not foul and must have at least a triple on the top row or a four of a kind on the bottom row.

Two Player Pineapple:
This game mode has similar rules to one player pineapple. In this mode, there are two players playing against each other. The score each player earns is the difference in point values between their hands and their opponent's hands. Additionally, each row won will give an extra point to the winner of that row. If all three rows are won by a player, that player receives a "scoop" bonus of three points.
